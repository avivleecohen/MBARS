#Acknowledgements
Testing, development, and application of this algorithm have been funded at various stages by both the Louisiana Space Consortium (LaSPACE) and the NASA Mars Data Analysis Program
(Grant #80NSSC21K1093). Drs. Karunatillake and Fassett must be credited for developing many of the original ideas and applications of what would ultimately become MBARS, before passing
along many of those ideas to Dr. Hood as a part of his Ph.D. Dissertation work.
